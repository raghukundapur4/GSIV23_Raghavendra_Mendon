# GSIV23_Raghavendra_Mendon

This React project is a web application that displays recent movie details and provides search functionality. It utilizes React Router for navigation, Redux for state management, and asynchronous functions for data fetching.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GSIV23_Raghavendra_Mendon.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd GSIV23_Raghavendra_Mendon

3. Install project dependencies:
   npm install

4. Start the development server:
   npm start

5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

## How to Use:
1. Upon launching the application, you will see a list of recent movies with their basic details.
2. Use the search functionality at the top to search for movies by title.
3. Click on any movie card to view its detailed information on a separate page.
   
## Project Highlights:
1. React Router Implementation
I have effectively used React Router to enable navigation within the application. This allows users to click on movie cards and view detailed information on a separate page. React Router makes the application more user-friendly and organized.

2. Redux State Management:
I have employed Redux for state management. It efficiently manages the application's data, ensuring that the components receive the necessary data while maintaining a single source of truth. This choice improves the project's maintainability and scalability.

3. Asynchronous Data Fetching:
I have incorporated asynchronous functions to fetch movie data from an external API. Asynchronous programming ensures the application remains responsive while fetching data, providing a smoother user experience.

## Potential Improvements:

If I had an additional 4 hours available for this task, I would consider the following improvements:

1. UI/UX Enhancements: I would work on improving the overall user interface and experience by adding animations,     responsive design, and enhancing user interactions.

2. Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of movies to improve performance and load times when there are      many movies to display.

3. Error Handling: Enhance error handling and provide meaningful error messages to users when data fetching or 
   other operations fail.

4. Unit Tests: Write comprehensive unit tests for components and Redux actions/reducers to ensure the stability 
   and reliability of the application.

## Feedback
This challenge was a great opportunity to demonstrate my skills in React, Redux, and asynchronous programming. To further improve this challenge, it would be helpful to provide more specific requirements or constraints to showcase problem-solving skills and creativity effectively.
